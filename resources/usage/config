CONFIG:

Your fez config files has the follow format:

{ /* DIST MANAGEMENT DATA */
  "groups":     [string],
  "key":        string,
  "un":         string,

  /* CONFIGURATION */
  "requestors": [string],
  "bundlers":   [string],
  "host":       string,
}

The Dist Management Data should mostly be left alone.

The configuration section, however, can be played around with.

"requestors" contains modules that are available to fez and will load
at runtime.  To implement your own the class provided in this array
should satisfy the interface:

method head($url, :%headers = () --> Array[Str]);
method get($url, :%headers = () --> Str);
method post($url, :$method = 'POST', :$data = '', :$file = '', :%headers = () --> Str);
method able(--> Bool);

and "bundlers" should satisfy the interface:

method bundle($location, @manifest --> Bool);
method ls($file --> Array[Str]);
method cat($file, $path --> Buf[uint8]);
method able(--> Bool);

Your current config path is: $user-config-path
                             $system-config-path

Effective configuration is:
$effective-config
