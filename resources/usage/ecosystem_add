USAGE

  fez e a [-f] <url>

  fez ecosystem add [--force] <url>

FLAGS

  OPTIONAL

  -f|--force              will overwrite the ecosystem info currently stored
                          rather than throwing an error when the ecosystem is
                          already known

Will query <url> for the ecosystem's prefix and add that information to the
ecosystems your client knows about.
